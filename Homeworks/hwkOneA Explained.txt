First:
	Create long int called b1 and b2. We want to shift x right (15 - n) four times and mask it with &0xF.
	We do 15 - n becuase there are 15 positions in hexadecimal and masking with 0xF is the same reason.
	We do it four times is becuase there are for bits in nibble.

	We then created another variable long int b and then we xor b1 and b2 together. This will create a
	merged nibble and finds the positions we want to swap.

Second:
	We apply left shift four times to b. Then or both n and m. This will put positions we found back to
	their place.

Third:
	We will now xor x and b together to keep the position we want to swap and not change other bits.
